# GrindURUS Frontend ICP

This repository contains the frontend of the **GrindURUS Protocol**, deployed on the **Internet Computer (ICP)** using a frontend canister. The frontend is built with **TypeScript** and leverages **dfx** for canister management and deployment.

## 🚀 Overview

GrindURUS is a decentralized protocol with multiple components. This frontend provides an interface for interacting with various parts of the protocol, including minting, burning, depositing tokens, and accessing AI-powered tools.

## 📁 Structure

- `src/grindurus-frontend` — Source files for the frontend canister.
- `package.json` — Dependencies and scripts for the frontend.
- `dfx.json` — Configuration file for canisters on the Internet Computer.

- [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/building-apps/developer-tools/dfx/dfx-parent)

### 🎞 Installation & Deployment

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 🚀 Local Deployment (IC Local Replica)

1. **Start the local replica**:

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy the frontend canister locally**:

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

3. **Access the frontend**:

   After deployment, open the local frontend in your browser. The URL will look like:

   ```
   http://<canister_id>.localhost:4943
   ```

   You can find the canister ID in `.dfx/local/canister_ids.json`.

### 🌐 Deployment to ICP Mainnet

> Make sure you're authenticated with your Internet Identity or have access to a wallet that can sign deployments.

1. **Deploy to the Internet Computer mainnet**:

   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network ic
   ```

2. **Access the frontend**:

   After a successful deployment, you'll get a public URL like:

   ```
   https://<canister_id>.icp0.io
   ```
